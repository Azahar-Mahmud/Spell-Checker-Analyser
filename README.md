# Spell-Checker-Analyser
This program is a powerful spell checker that detects misspelled words, suggests corrections, and tracks performance. It uses hash tables for the dictionary, string matching for validation, and dynamic programming (Knapsack and LCS) to optimize suggestions. It processes input files, checks spelling, provides corrections, and logs execution times.
